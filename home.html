				<h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
				<details>
					<summary>Who invented Tacos?</summary>
					<p>
						The invention of tacos cannot be attributed to a single individual or moment in history. Instead, tacos are
						a culinary creation that evolved over centuries, primarily within the indigenous cultures of Mexico, long
						before Spanish colonization. Their development is a testament to the blending of local traditions and
						available ingredients, making them a collective invention of Mexican culture
					</p>

				<details>
					<summary>What are Tacos?</summary>
					<p>
						At their core, tacos are a harmonious blend of a corn or wheat tortilla wrapped around a filling. This
						filling can vary widely, from grilled meats and seafood to vegetables and beans, often accompanied by a
						variety of salsas, onions, cilantro, and other fresh garnishes. The beauty of tacos lies in their simplicity
						and versatility, allowing for endless variations and personalization.
					</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Are tacos Mexicans?</summary>
					<p>
						To question whether tacos are Mexican is to delve into a complex tapestry of history and culture. While
						tacos have undergone significant evolution and global adaptation, their soul remains deeply rooted in
						Mexican tradition. They are a culinary symbol of Mexicoâ€™s rich history, diverse culture, and enduring
						influence on global cuisine.
